## Context

This section describes the problem, the context, and the forces at play. It should be written in a way that a future developer can understand the state of the system and the problem that needed to be solved at the time the decision was made.

What is the issue, problem, or force we are addressing? What are the constraints and assumptions?

## Decision

This section describes the solution. It should be clear and concise, detailing the change we are making to the system.

### Positive Consequences

*   What becomes better? (e.g., improved performance, better developer experience, more resilient)

### Negative Consequences

*   What becomes worse? (e.g., increased complexity, harder to debug, a specific feature becomes more difficult to implement)

### Neutral Consequences (Trade-offs)

*   What are the trade-offs? (e.g., we gain X but lose Y, we are locking ourselves into a specific vendor)
